# Industrial_Copper_Modelling
Problem Statement:
The dataset is taken from copper industry and this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. The goal is to create a machine learning model which can address these issues with advanced techniques such as feature scaling , outlier detection etc.
## Skills used in this project:
Python scripting
 
Data Preprocessing
 
EDA

Streamlit

## The solution includes the following :
-> Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.

-> Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

-> ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’.

-> ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.

-> Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost)
